Example usage of "Free McDialogue" -- My dialogue tool made for Unity in C#

The Game is an example of the dialogue system in action, with everything set up correctly.

The McDialogue 1.0 folder holds a WPF Application that is helpful for parsing text into dialogue sequences.  These sequences are chained together by the dialogue manager to make dialogue trees.
